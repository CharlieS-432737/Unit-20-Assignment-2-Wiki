# <u>**Network code of practice**</u>

- **Network Security**: All network devices and software must be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Passwords must be strong and changed regularly. Firewalls and antivirus software must be installed and configured to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential threats.

- **User Access**: User access to the network must be controlled through the use of user accounts and passwords. Users must only be given access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. User accounts must be disabled or removed when users leave the company.

- **Data Protection**: All data stored on the network must be protected from unauthorized access and potential threats. Data backups must be performed regularly to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster or system failure.

- **Network Monitoring**: The network must be monitored regularly to detect any potential issues or security threats. Network logs must be reviewed regularly to identify any suspicious activity.

- **Network Performance**: The network must be monitored regularly to ensure that it is performing optimally. Network bandwidth must be monitored to ensure that it is not being overused, and network devices must be upgraded or replaced as needed to ensure that they can handle the workload.

- **Network Documentation**: All network devices and software must be documented, including IP addresses, network topology, and configuration settings. This documentation must be kept up to date and stored in a secure location.
