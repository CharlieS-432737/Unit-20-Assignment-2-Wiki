# <u>**Security breach**</u>

If the organisation's network were to have a security breach there are the steps that should be taken:

1. **Identify the breach**: The first step is to identify the extent of the security breach. This can be done by viewing network logs and security systems.

2. **Containment**: Once the security breach has been identified, the next step is to contain the breach to prevent it from spreading further. This can be done by disconnecting the affected systems from the network.

3. **Assessment of the damage**: The next step is to assess the damage caused by the security breach. This involves identifying the data and systems that have been compromised, determining the extent of the damage, and evaluating the potential impact of the breach on the organisation.

4. **Notification**: If the breach involves personal data or other sensitive information, the organisation may be required by law to notify affected individuals and/or regulatory authorities. The organisation should also notify its employees, partners, and customers about the breach.

5. **Investigation**: The organisation should conduct a detailed investigation to determine how the security breach occurred, who was responsible, and what steps can be taken to prevent similar breaches in the future.

6. **Recovery**: Once the security breach has been contained and the damage assessed, the organisation can begin the process of recovery. This may involve restoring data and systems from backups, repairing or replacing damaged hardware, and implementing new security measures to prevent future breaches.
