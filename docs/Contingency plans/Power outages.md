# <u>**Power outages**</u>

If the organisation experiences a power outage, these steps should be taken:

1. Due to the power outage most machines will not work in the building so employees must be notified and do work from home if possible.

2. All servers and important desktops will be protected by a UPS (uninterruptible power supply). This will allow any important machines to be shut down correctly. After a power outage occurs the servers and important desktops should be shut down asap to avoid data loss and/or corruption of data.

3. Once power has returned all servers and desktops should be turned on and disk-checking tools should be run to search for any corrupt data. Tools like sfc and chkdsk are built into windows and can perform these tasks. For Linux, the fsck tool can be used.

4. If data has been lost or corrupted a backup can be used to restore that system.
