# <u>**Natural disasters**</u>

In the case of a natural disaster that has affected the organisation's network, all traffic will be rerouted to backup servers. If the natural disaster has damaged or destroyed hardware new hardware will need to be brought. Once new servers and hardware has been setup backups from the off-site backups will be used to restore all files and folders to the system.
