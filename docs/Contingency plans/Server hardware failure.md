# <u>**Server hardware failure**</u>

If the organisation experiences a server hardware failure these steps should be taken:

1. **Identify the failure**: The first step is to identify server hardware failure. This can be done by viewing server logs and monitoring systems.

2. **Containment**: Once the hardware failure has been identified, the next step is to contain the impact of the failure to prevent it from spreading further. This can be done by taking the affected server offline and rerouting traffic to other servers or backup systems.

3. **Assessment of the damage**: The next step is to assess the damage caused by the hardware failure. This involves determining the extent of the damage, evaluating the potential impact of the failure on the organisation's operations, and identifying any data or systems that have been affected.

4. **Restore from backups**: The next step is to restore the affected data and systems from the backup.

5. **Repair or replace hardware**: Once the data and systems have been restored from backups, the next step is to repair or replace the faulty hardware.

6. **Recovery**: Once the hardware has been repaired or replaced, the organisation can begin the process of recovery. This may involve restoring any data or systems that were not included in the backup, testing the repaired or replaced hardware, and implementing any necessary security updates or patches.
