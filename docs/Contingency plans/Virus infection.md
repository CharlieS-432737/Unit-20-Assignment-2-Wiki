# <u>**Virus infection**</u>

If the organisation's network were to come under attack from a virus there are the steps that should be taken:

1. **Identification**: Once a virus has been discovered on the network an antivirus scan using Malwarebytes will be performed on every desktop and server on the network. This scan will identify what machines have been affected and the type of virus.

2. **Containment**: Once affect machines have been identified they will be taken off the network to prevent the spread of the virus. They will be moved and connected to a private network without access to the internet or the organisation's network.

3. **Assess the damage**: Once the machine has been contained the next step is to identify the files and data that may have been affected.

4. **Restore**: Once the damage has been assessed a restore of a backup before the virus infection will be conducted. This will restore all files that may have been affected.

5. **Eradication**: After a restore has been completed a second antivirus scan will be performed to confirm the virus has been eradicated from the machine

6. **Recovery**: Once the virus has been completely removed from the network the affected machines will be connected back to the network. If the software is now missing after the restore it will be installed.

7. **Prevention**: Methods will be put in place to prevent a future attack from the same virus.
