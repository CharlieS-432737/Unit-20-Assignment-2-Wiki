# <u>**Backups and restoring procedures**</u>

All machines that require backups to be made (like servers and desktops) will have a 3 2 1 backup strategy. The backups will only consist of files and folders that are deemed important. This will help prevent backups from taking too long and taking up a lot of storage.

A 3 2 1 backups strategy consists of:

1. A local copy of files on the machine
2. A local backup of the machine on the organisation's servers
3. A remote off-site backup (uploaded to the cloud)

If a restore need to be done then the backups can be accessed. The most recent backup should be used to restore the machine.
