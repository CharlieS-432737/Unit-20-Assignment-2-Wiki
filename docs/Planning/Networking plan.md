# <u>**Networking plan**</u>

All workstations, the server and the printers will be connected to the network via an ethernet cable. This will require a switch to be used that has at least 35 ports on it. 30 ports for the workstations, 3 ports for the printers, 1 for the server and 1 to connect the network to a router for internet access.
