# <u>**Security polices**</u>

Each windows system will have a set of security policies to help protect it from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

The following policies will be set up:

## Account lockout policies

These policies limit the number of failed login attempts before an account is locked out for a specified period. The number of failed login attempts will be set to 5 and if an account gets locked out, it will get locked out for 2 hours. An employee can request their account to be unlocked if they got locked out.

## User rights assignment policies

These policies determine the permissions and privileges that users have on the network, such as the ability to install software or modify system settings. Only the IT technician will be permitted to install software and modify system settings.

## Audit policies

These policies define what activities are logged and monitored on the network, including logon events, file access, and system changes. All events on the system will be logged.

## Firewall policies

These policies configure the Windows Firewall to block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on specific criteria. This will be confirmed around the software that the organisation is using but will not be as restricted as the main firewall on the network.

## Encryption policies

These policies require that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.

## Software restriction policies

These policies restrict the types of software that can be installed and executed on network systems, reducing the risk of malware infections.
