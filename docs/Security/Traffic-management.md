# <u>**Traffic management**</u>

## Network Bandwidth

The network bandwidth will be monitored regularly to ensure that it is not being overused. Network bandwidth will be allocated based on the user's job function and level of access required.

## Network Traffic Prioritization

Network traffic will be prioritized based on the user's job function and level of access required. Critical network traffic, such as VoIP and video conferencing, will be given higher priority than non-critical traffic, such as email and web browsing.

## Network Traffic Shaping

Network traffic shaping will be used to manage network traffic and ensure that critical network traffic is given priority over non-critical traffic. Network traffic shaping will be configured by the IT support team.

## Network Monitoring

The network will be monitored regularly to detect any potential issues or security threats. Network logs will be reviewed regularly to identify any suspicious activity.

## Network Performance

The network will be monitored regularly to ensure that it is performing optimally. Network devices will be upgraded or replaced as needed to ensure that they can handle the workload.

## Based on feedback

### Firewall

An advanced firewall solution, incorporating state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, will be deployed to effectively control and regulate the flow of network traffic, ensuring only authorized access in and out of the network.

### Encryption

To enhance the security of data transmission within the network, strong encryption protocols will be implemented. All sensitive information, including user credentials, confidential documents, and communication data, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the network, the encrypted data remains unintelligible and protected from interception or tampering. Additionally, encryption keys will be securely managed to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data.
