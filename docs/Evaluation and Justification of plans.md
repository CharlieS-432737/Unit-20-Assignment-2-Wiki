# <u>**Evaluation/Justification of plans**</u>

## Management and support infrastructure

The management and support infrastructure plan provides effective support to the system's users by ensuring that the network is secure, reliable, and performing optimally. The network code of practice ensures that the network is secure by requiring that all network devices and software are kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates, passwords are strong and changed regularly, firewalls and antivirus software are installed and configured, and network access is controlled through the use of user accounts and passwords. This helps to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential threats.

## Support request and escalation procedures

The support request and escalation procedures ensure that support requests are addressed in a timely manner and that users are kept informed of the status of their requests. The service level agreement proposal sets clear expectations for network uptime, response time for support requests, resolution time for support requests, and regular backups of important data. This helps to ensure that users receive the support they need to perform their job functions and that the network is reliable and available when needed.

## Contingency plans

The contingency plans ensure that the network can be restored in the event of a disaster or system failure. Regular data backups are performed to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster or system failure, and a disaster recovery plan is developed and tested regularly to ensure that the network can be restored in the event of a disaster. This helps to ensure that the network is available when needed and that data is protected from loss.

## User support documentation

The user support documentation provides users with the information they need to access IT support services and troubleshoot common technical issues. Password reset procedures are provided to users to help them regain access to their accounts if they forget their passwords. This helps to ensure that users can access the support they need to perform their job functions and that they can troubleshoot common technical issues on their own.

## Security policies, access control, and traffic management

The security policies, access control, and traffic management expectations ensure that the network is secure and that critical network traffic is given priority over non-critical traffic. User accounts are created based on the user's job function and level of access required, passwords are strong and changed regularly, and users are only given access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. Network traffic is prioritized based on the user's job function and level of access required, and the network is monitored regularly to detect any potential issues or security threats. This helps to ensure that the network is secure and that critical network traffic is given priority over non-critical traffic.

## User desktop interface

The user desktop interface design provides users with a standard desktop that includes the company logo as the background image and shortcut icons for word processing, spreadsheet, calculator, file explorer, and Google Chrome. This helps to ensure that users have a consistent experience when using the network and that they can easily access the applications they need to perform their job functions.

## System and network requirements

The system and network requirements ensure that the network is capable of handling the workload and that data is protected from loss. The networked PCs and server computer have sufficient RAM and storage to support the users' job functions, and the networked printers are capable of printing at least 20 pages per minute and with a minimum resolution of 1200 x 1200 dpi. The LAN is capable of supporting at least 30 devices and with a minimum bandwidth of 1 Gbps, and the internet connectivity has a minimum bandwidth of 50 Mbps. Software applications are compatible with the operating system installed on the networked PCs and server computer. This helps to ensure that the network is capable of handling the workload and that data is protected from loss.

## Conclusion

Overall, the management and support infrastructure plan provides effective support to the system's users by ensuring that the network is secure, reliable, and performing optimally. The plan includes a network code of practice, support request and escalation procedures, a service level agreement proposal, contingency plans, user support documentation, security policies, access control, and traffic management expectations, user desktop interface design, system and network requirements, and backup procedures. These measures ensure that the network is capable of handling the workload and that data is protected from unauthorized access and potential threats.
