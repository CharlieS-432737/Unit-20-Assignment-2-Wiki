**Problem:**

The user was attempting to access Facebook from the organizations network.

**What happened?:**

A level 2 support technician determined that the issue was caused by the networks firewall causing this ticket to get escalated to Level 3 support.

**Escalation:**

Ticket was originally for Level 1 support however, they could not solve the users problem. Because of this the ticket was escalated to Level 2 support. After a Level 2 support technician had a look at the issue, they determined that the issue was to do with the firewall of the network. The ticket was then escalated again to Level 3 support because Level 3 support technicians are the only ones able to access the networks firewall.

**Solution:**

A level 3 support technician was able to unblock www.facebook.com from the networks firewall by adding it as an exception
