# <u>**Software plan**</u>

## OS

- The workstations will have windows 11 installed on them.

- The server will have trueNAS installed on it

## Software

- The workstations will have Google chrome, Office 365 installed on them.

## Justification

- Im using windows 11 on the work stations because it is the latest version of windows to be released and will be supported the longest.

- Im using trueNAS for the server because it is easy and free to setup and has an easy to understand web interface that can be used to manage everything on the server.
