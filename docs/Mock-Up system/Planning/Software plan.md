# <u>**Software plan**</u>

## OS

- The workstations will have windows 11 installed on them.

- The server will have trueNAS installed on it

## Software

- The workstations will have Google chrome, Office 365 installed on them.

## Justification

- I've opted to utilize Windows 11 as the operating system for our work stations, as it represents the cutting-edge in Windows technology, being the latest version released and poised to receive long-term support.

- I've chosen TrueNAS as the operating system for our server due to its exceptional ease of setup and cost-effectiveness, boasting a user-friendly web interface that simplifies server management tasks.
