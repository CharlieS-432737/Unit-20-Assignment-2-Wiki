# <u>**Machine setup plan**</u>

## Workstations

### Desktops

The workstations' desktops will have the company logo as their background.

On the desktops, there will be shortcuts to Office 365 Word and Excel, the calculator app, file explorer and google chrome.

### Users

The workstations will be set up with three user groups:

- Junior Staff
- Managers
- Directors

These user groups will determine the level of access and privileges each user has on their respective workstations, addressing user support needs. The user security measures will be implemented based on the plans outlined in the security folder, which includes specific security measures and configurations to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user accounts and data.

### Storage

The workstations will have a single drive installed, with the OS and software. This drive will be mounted as the C: drive. Additionally, the workstations will have the NAS mapped as the D: drive. Employees will be instructed to save their work on the server rather than on their local machines, promoting secure data management.

### Improvements based on feedback

#### User Security

The user security aspects will be implemented based on the plans outlined in the security folder. These plans will outline the specific security measures and configurations required to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user accounts and data.

#### Optimizations for Performance and Security
To optimize performance and security, the following measures will be implemented:

- Regular software updates and security patches will be applied to the workstations to address any vulnerabilities and ensure system integrity.
- Caching mechanisms will be implemented to improve application performance and reduce network traffic.
- Network configurations will be optimized to enhance data transfer speeds and reduce latency.
- Encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS, will be implemented to secure data transmission over the network.
- User access controls will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure appropriate privileges and minimize security risks.

## Server

### Users

The server will be setup with three different user groups on it:

- Junior Staff
- Managers
- Directors

These user groups will enable efficient management of user access and permissions on the server, addressing user support needs. Similar to the workstations, the user security measures on the server will be implemented based on the plans outlined in the security folder, providing guidelines for user account management, password policies, and access controls.

### Folders

The server will be set up with three main folders:

1. General Folder: This folder will be fully accessible by all three user groups, promoting collaboration and information sharing.
2. Policies and Procedures Folder: This folder will have read-only access for junior staff and managers, while directors will have full access. This ensures that sensitive policies and procedures are only modified by authorized personnel.
3. Management Folder: The junior staff will not have access to this folder. Managers will have read-only access, allowing them to review information, while directors will have full access for efficient decision-making and oversight.

### Improvements based on feedback

#### Optimizations for Performance and Security
To optimize performance and security on the server, the following measures will be implemented:

- Regular backups of server data will be performed to ensure data integrity and facilitate disaster recovery in case of any issues. Backups will be stored securely in an offsite location.
- Redundancy measures, such as RAID configurations, will be implemented to enhance data availability and protect against data loss.
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems will be deployed to monitor and mitigate potential security threats.
- Network traffic monitoring tools will be utilized to identify any abnormal network activities and potential security breaches.
- Regular system performance monitoring will be conducted to identify any bottlenecks or issues and optimize resource allocation accordingly.
