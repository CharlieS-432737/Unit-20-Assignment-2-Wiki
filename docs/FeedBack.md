Devon Wyatt:
"Great plans, lots of detail, and good work. Only one thing. In the brief, it says, "Based on your experiences while supporting the system carry out optimisations of the system to improve its performance and security" in your work I can't find anywhere that clearly shows an optimisation to the performance or security."

## How I have used feedback in the mock-up system

The feedback received guided the implementation of a managed and supported IT system. It emphasized the importance of system performance, security, and usability. The implementation phase involved incorporating optimizations for performance and security, configuring network devices, updating software, and implementing access control measures. Usability was improved through a user-friendly desktop interface. Continuous feedback loops allowed for ongoing assessment and refinement of the system. The implemented IT system now meets the organization's requirements more effectively.

## How it has improved my plans

The feedback received on my plans has helped improve the security measures implemented in the mock-up system. Based on the feedback, specific enhancements have been made to strengthen network security, control user access to sensitive information and implement data encryption.These improvements ensure that the system is more secure and better protects the organization's data.
