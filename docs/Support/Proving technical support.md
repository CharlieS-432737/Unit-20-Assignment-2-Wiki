# <u>**Proving technical support**</u>

The organization will have a support team that will respond to support requests made by employees. Employees will be able to make a support ticket using several methods:

- A telephone help desk
  - The employees will have the ability to phone the help desk to help resolve simple problems or to help create a support ticket on the organisation's support database.
- A web-based reporting tool
  - Employees will be able to access a web-based system to give them the ability to make a support request on the organisation support database.
- A support email
  - Employees will have the ability to email the support team using a support email.

All support requests made will be added to a support database that can be viewed by the support team. The support request will contain: the name of the requester, location, date and time, the issue, a description of the issue, the machine that support is needed on and the steps to reproduce the issue the employee is experiencing.
