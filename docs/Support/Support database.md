# <u>**Support database**</u>

Once a support request has been added to the database an automated system will assign an IT technician to the request. The IT technician will make notes and help the requester fix the issue. Once the issue is fixed the IT technician can add the solution to the request and mark it as fixed. If an issue remains unresolved for a set amount of days or if the issue is more complex than expected, then the issue can be escalated.
