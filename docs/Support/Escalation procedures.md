# <u>**Escalation procedures**</u>

Level 1 Support: The first point of contact for IT support issues is the help desk or service desk. Level 1 support technicians are responsible for resolving basic issues such as password resets, software installations, and network connectivity problems.

Level 2 Support: If the issue cannot be resolved by Level 1 support, it is escalated to Level 2 support. Level 2 support technicians have more advanced technical skills and are able to troubleshoot and resolve more complex issues such as server outages, database errors, and hardware failures.

Level 3 Support: If the issue cannot be resolved by Level 2 support, it is escalated to Level 3 support. Level 3 support technicians are the most senior and experienced members of the IT support team. They have deep technical expertise and are able to diagnose and resolve the most complex and critical issues.

Escalation Path: If the issue cannot be resolved by Level 3 support, it is escalated to the appropriate vendor or manufacturer for further assistance. The escalation path should be clearly defined and documented to ensure that issues are resolved in a timely and efficient manner.

Communication: Throughout the escalation process, clear and timely communication is essential. IT support technicians should keep the user informed of the status of their issue and provide regular updates on progress towards resolution. Additionally, IT support managers should be notified of any issues that require escalation to ensure that they are aware of potential service disruptions and can take appropriate action.
